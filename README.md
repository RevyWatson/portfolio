# Portfolio

This is the first of many, many, many, drafts that I will inevitably be creating to showcase my work as a web developer.

## The Process and Current Product

Given the time constraints I chose to keep my design relatively simple. My focus was on functionally first and foremost. Figured I could fiddle with aesthetics afterwards. That said, it still needs a great deal of work in both of those departments. I was unable to figure out the @media query aspects. Admittedly I’m just barely grasping an understanding of flexbox too. In an attempt to have working links for each of the project place holder images, I threw together three quick and dirty websites. All have the same formatting and content but for some reason when deployed they load with only the title of the repository name on the page. I’m hoping that this is just a temporary glitch within the GitHub system and that it will work itself out in time. 

## The Future Vision

I have hopes that in the in the coming months as I practice and study that my understanding of these concepts and languages will improve. With time, repetition and much patience I hope that I can deploy a more functional and aesthetically pleasing application.
